- UniTest - tests just one Case of one 
logic part of the code(one method)
- after adjustment use old tests again
- always test the borders variables
- if their is a problem, you are at the same place
- old functionality is not breaking
- mostly simpler, because you just test small part
-(SOLID)
- IntegrationTest - test different parts of 
the code (multiple methods)
- if their is a problem, you have to find it first
- EndToEndTest - tests the functionality of 
whole program/interface(tester don't know the
inside of program, blackbox)
